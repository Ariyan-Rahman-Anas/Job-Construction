Here are 5 key points of this project:
# 1. Role-based Access Control (RBAC):
Implement a robust RBAC system to control access to different sections of the application based on user roles. Define roles like "Admin," "Job Owner," and "Bidding User" to regulate access to job details, bid requests, and other private pages.

# 2. Firebase Authentication Integration:
Utilize Firebase Authentication to secure the login and registration pages. Leverage email/password authentication with password validation using regex to ensure strong password policies. Enable social login options, such as Google login, to enhance user convenience.

# 3. Private Routes and Conditional Rendering:
Set up private routes for pages like "Job Details," "Add Job," "Bid Requests," and "My Bids." Conditionally render components based on the user's authentication statusâ€”allowing only logged-in users to access these private pages and features.

# 4. Job Posting and Bidding System:
Develop a seamless job posting system where logged-in users can add new jobs. Implement a bidding system that allows other users to submit bids. Provide a bid requests page for job owners to review and manage bids, including the ability to accept or reject bids.

# 5. User Dashboard and Profile Management:
Create a user dashboard that includes a "My Bids" page where users can track jobs they have bid on. Implement profile management functionalities, allowing users to view and edit their profile information. Ensure a smooth user experience for navigating and interacting with their personalized dashboard.
